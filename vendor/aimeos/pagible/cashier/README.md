# Pagible Cashier

Payment-backed frontend access for Pagible CMS through Laravel Cashier. Choose
one provider package per application:

## Installation

Pagible CMS, Laravel authentication, and a named `login` route must already be
available. Checkout requires a stored, authenticated Eloquent user. Guests who
click a pricing button are sent to `login`, and their checkout resumes after
authentication.

```bash
composer require aimeos/pagible-cashier-stripe
# or: aimeos/pagible-cashier-paddle
# or: aimeos/pagible-cashier-mollie

php artisan cms:install:cashier
```

`cms:install:cashier` detects the single installed provider, checks for an
application-owned `users.access` conflict, publishes its upstream Cashier and
adapter migrations, and runs all outstanding migrations. Use `--no-migrate`
only when the deployment pipeline runs migrations separately. Add `--force`
when migrations must run non-interactively in production. When Stripe and its
prerequisites are configured, an interactive installation offers to create the
webhook and defaults to **yes**. A non-interactive installation never creates it
unless `--webhook` is supplied explicitly; that option performs no second
prompt.

The installer finishes with a local readiness report. Run the same idempotent,
read-only check again after changing the model or configuration:

```bash
php artisan cms:cashier:check
```

It returns a non-zero status until the provider registration, `APP_KEY`,
`APP_URL`, named `login` route, checkout and webhook routes, authentication
model traits, Cashier schema, access catalog, API credentials, and webhook
verification are ready. Its **Developer next steps** section combines failed
local checks with the dashboard and end-to-end tasks that cannot be performed
locally.

Add `Aimeos\Cms\Concerns\CashierAccess` beside the provider's `Billable` trait
on the application user model. The trait reserves, guards, casts, and hides the
`users.access` attribute. Do not add `access` to the user model's `$fillable`
list or accept it in profile/account input; only Pagible Cashier may write it.

For Stripe and Mollie, the model setup is:

```php
use Aimeos\Cms\Concerns\CashierAccess;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Laravel\Cashier\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use CashierAccess;
    use Billable;
}
```

Paddle uses `Laravel\Paddle\Billable` instead. Keep any provider-specific model
customization required by the upstream Cashier package.

Pagible's normal tenancy rule still applies. Without tenancy configuration, any
authenticated user belongs to the default tenant. In a tenant-aware application,
the user's `tenant_id` must match the active tenant unless the application
deliberately overrides `Tenancy::$access`.

Each provider package installs the shared Pagible integration and exactly one
upstream Cashier package. Composer conflicts prevent another Pagible adapter or
upstream Cashier provider from being installed in the same application. The
installed package is the provider configuration; there is no
`CMS_CASHIER_PROVIDER` setting that can drift from the dependencies.

Each adapter owns its provider, webhook listeners, service provider, migrations,
and assets. Laravel discovers that service provider, which binds the
application's single `CashierProvider`. The shared installation command publishes
the upstream Cashier migrations. Provider-specific model, credential, webhook,
and scheduler steps remain explicit because a package must not rewrite the host
model or environment file, create provider products, or change external webhook
destinations without an explicit request. For Stripe only,
`php artisan cms:install:cashier --webhook` validates `APP_URL` and the Stripe
API credentials, resolves the registered webhook route, and runs Cashier's
webhook command explicitly. Without that option, only an interactive command
offers to create the endpoint.

Complete the setup for the installed provider before creating pricing content:

* [Stripe setup](https://github.com/aimeos/pagible-cashier-stripe)
* [Paddle setup](https://github.com/aimeos/pagible-cashier-paddle)
* [Mollie setup](https://github.com/aimeos/pagible-cashier-mollie)

## Frontend access catalog

Cashier adds payment-derived grants to Pagible's existing frontend access
system; it does not define the available role names. Configure an access catalog
in an application service provider before assigning roles to pricing packages or
pages. A fixed catalog is sufficient for a simple installation:

```php
use Aimeos\Cms\Access;

public function boot(): void
{
    Access::using(fn() => [
        'course-buyers',
        'premium-members',
    ]);
}
```

The callback may return different values for the active tenant. This example is
read-only: editors can select its values but cannot create or delete them in the
admin. Use the `add` and `delete` callbacks, or configure the Bouncer, Laratrust,
or Spatie adapter described in the
[core access-catalog documentation](https://github.com/aimeos/pagible-core),
when editors should manage the catalog.

The pricing package and every page sold by that package must use the same exact
catalog value. Payment roles are tenant-specific and are ignored if they are not
part of the current tenant's catalog.

## Selling restricted pages

1. Finish the selected provider's credential and webhook setup. Webhooks are
   authoritative for granting, renewing, refunding, and revoking access.
2. In the CMS admin, add a `pricing` element to a public sales page. Add a
   package, choose its frontend access role, add one or more prices, and publish
   the page or shared element.
3. Open each page being sold, choose **Access**, select **Restricted**, select
   the same role, and apply the change. Applying recursively protects the page's
   descendants too. This action requires `page:access`.
4. Keep the sales page public. Use a public account or payment-status page as the
   target URL because the browser can return before the verified webhook has
   granted access.
5. Test the complete flow in the provider's sandbox: guest login, checkout,
   webhook delivery, authorized page access, cancellation, and a full refund or
   chargeback.

Restricting a page does not make files on a public storage URL private. Configure
`CMS_PRIVATE_DISK` to a non-public Laravel disk and enable **Protect with page
access** for files that must only be delivered with the restricted page.

## Pricing products

Products live in each tenant's published `pricing` content, not application
configuration. This keeps products tenant-editable in SaaS installations. A
package owns one frontend access role and contains up to five prices. The
installed adapter supplies the provider for every price:

```json
{
  "id": "professional",
  "name": "Professional",
  "access": "premium-members",
  "url": "/account",
  "prices": [
    {
      "id": "monthly",
      "reference": "price_123",
      "kind": "subscription",
      "currency": "EUR",
      "amount": 19.00,
      "unit": "month"
    },
    {
      "id": "lifetime",
      "reference": "price_456",
      "kind": "once",
      "currency": "EUR",
      "amount": 199.00,
      "unit": "once"
    }
  ]
}
```

Package and price identifiers are generated automatically and stored with the
pricing content, but aren't shown as editable fields. Copying a package creates
new package and price identifiers; cutting and pasting preserves them.

The frontend derives its toggle captions from the distinct non-empty `unit`
values and selects matching prices across packages. Packages without the
selected unit keep their first price.

For packages with `access`, `url` is the local page shown after checkout. Without
`access`, it is rendered directly as a page, fragment, or contact link and the
package may omit `reference`, `kind`, and `currency`; those fields remain
mandatory at runtime for packages that start checkout.

Pricing uses the ordinary CMS permissions. Editors with `page:save` can control
the access role and prices of inline pricing content; shared pricing elements
use `element:save`. Publication and scheduling continue to use the normal page
and element publication permissions. Checkout accepts an access role only when
it exists in the current tenant's `Access` catalog.

The rendered form posts only the published page, pricing element, package, and
price identifiers. The server resolves the payment reference, access role,
payment kind, and target URL from published content, obtains the provider
from the installed adapter, then signs the metadata sent to Cashier.

The CMS pricing fields have these meanings:

* **Payment type:** Use `subscription` or `once`. For Stripe and Paddle, it must
  match whether the provider price is recurring or one-time.
* **Payment reference:** Use the provider price ID for Stripe and Paddle, such as
  `price_123` or `pri_123`. For Mollie, use the decimal charge amount with two
  digits, such as `19.00`.
* **Currency:** Use a three-letter uppercase currency code for every provider.
* **Billing interval:** Stripe and Paddle do not use it, so it may be omitted or
  `0`. Mollie subscriptions require a length from 1 to 365 days; Mollie one-time
  payments may omit it or use `0`.
* **Amount, displayed price, and price unit:** These fields control only the
  rendered pricing display. The Stripe or Paddle price and the Mollie payment
  reference remain authoritative for the charge.

The target URL must be a local URL beginning with `/`. It is used after checkout;
invalid or external values fall back to `/`. For Mollie, keep package names to 80
characters or fewer because they become the invoice description.

For Stripe and Paddle, `reference` is the provider-managed price ID. For Mollie,
it is the decimal amount (for example `"19.00"`), accompanied by `currency` and,
for subscriptions, `interval` as an integer number of days from 1 to 365.
One-time prices may leave the interval empty, use `0`, or omit it. The package
name becomes the invoice description. Pagible converts the day count to Mollie's
interval format and signs these values into the plan name stored in Cashier's own subscription row.
It supplies a plan repository at runtime. This avoids
`cashier_plans.php` and a Pagible product table. Pagible also schedules Mollie's
`cashier:run` command every five minutes; the application scheduler still needs
to be running. Mollie reads authoritative remote payment state before its
Cashier webhook controller continues and acknowledges the request only after
the `users.access` mutation commits. Projection failures therefore remain
retryable. Webhooks embed refund and chargeback collections and order removals
use the newest completed refund or active chargeback timestamp.
If Mollie supplies an adverse aggregate without a usable event timestamp, the
webhook fails for retry instead of substituting local receipt time.
Source lookup indexes keep webhook resolution bounded.
The Mollie adapter adds its required customer and mandate columns to `users`;
the shared integration knows nothing about them.

Stripe redirects to its hosted checkout. Paddle creates the transaction and
binds the signed CMS metadata on the server, then exposes only the transaction
ID to the inline Paddle.js checkout. Recurring checkouts use a tenant-keyed
`subscription_type`, so local subscriptions remain distinct without trusting
browser-submitted product data.

## Access state

Cashier's verified webhook events maintain the hidden JSON `users.access`
projection:

```json
{
  "acme|stripe|sub_123": {
    "role": "premium-members",
    "end": 1787745600000,
    "at": 1787745600000
  },
  "acme|stripe|pi_456": {
    "role": "course-buyers",
    "end": null,
    "at": 1785157200000
  },
  "acme|paddle|txn_789": {
    "role": null,
    "end": null,
    "at": 1785243600000
  }
}
```

`users.access` is a package-reserved authorization projection, not application
profile data. Application code must not mass assign, `forceFill()`, or update the
column directly.

Each top-level key combines the tenant ID, provider, and payment source
identifier using `|` separators. Provider and source identifiers cannot contain
`|`; any preceding separators remain part of the tenant ID.
Subscription sources always have their verified paid-through `end` as a Unix
timestamp in milliseconds. Successful one-time payments use `null`. `at` is the
provider event time in the same format. Revoked sources remain as role-less
tombstones so a delayed older webhook cannot restore access. A role remains
active in its tenant while any source entry is permanent or has a future end.

Checkout rejects new starts when the current projection already contains 128
payment sources or reaches 128 KiB. This is an admission bound rather than a
distributed reservation: concurrent starts can observe the same projection,
and already-created provider checkouts and verified webhook mutations are still
honored so a successful payment is never left without its access update.

Provider-confirmed paid invoices, transactions, and orders renew the source.
Status-only subscription updates never restore access. Failed renewals and
scheduled cancellations retain access through the already paid period.
Provider-confirmed subscription deletion, immediate cancellation, full refund,
or chargeback tombstones the affected source. Repeated and out-of-order webhook
delivery is idempotent. Local Cashier ownership may revoke an existing source,
but only source-bound signed CMS metadata may create a tombstone for an unknown
source.

Applications may schedule end-of-period cancellation through
`DELETE /cmsapi/cashier/{subscription}`. The active driver and authenticated
user's Cashier relationship scope ownership; the verified provider lifecycle
event remains authoritative for access removal.

## Frontend authorization

Payment roles are added to the existing Pagible `Access` grants. They do not
replace a custom Bouncer, Laratrust, Spatie, or `Access::using()` resolver.
Frontend page rendering reads no subscription table: the authenticated user
query supplies `users.access`. Page rendering, navigation, pricing checkout,
and JSON:API all use the same database-side access predicate. An effective
`grants` callback avoids Gate calls for each catalog value; its results are
filtered through the configured catalog and memoized per user and tenant for
the request.

Webhook handling and the corresponding `users.access` mutation are synchronous.
An exception prevents a successful response so the payment provider can retry
the event. Provider retries are the only recovery mechanism for failed webhook
delivery; monitor webhook endpoints and exhausted deliveries. If every retry
for a one-time refund or chargeback is exhausted, permanent access may require
manual revocation. Mollie installations must still run Laravel's scheduler for
Cashier Mollie's normal `cashier:run` subscription billing command.
